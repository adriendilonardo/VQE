Recommended Python Version:

3.9.12

Required packages - installed in the python path (using pip or otherwise):

numpy - (1.12.5 - recommended version)
scipy - (1.7.3 - recommended version)
sympy - (1.10.1 - recommended version)
cirq - (1.2.0 - recommended version)
pennylane - (0.30.0 - recommended version)

--------- Installation intructions ---------

Downloads - Ensure that you have downloaded the following files, either by cloning the github repo or otherwise:

- VQE.py
- VQE_Example.ipynb (optional - tutorial for getting started)
- UnitTests.py (optional - contains units tests)

Also ensure that the above required packages have been installed and are accessible in the python path.

Adding to python path - To use the functions inside VQE.py, it must be in the python path. 
The simple workaround to this is to include the following python code at the top of any script or notebook which will use functions from VQE:

import sys
sys.path
sys.path.append('<path to file>VQE.py')

where <path to file> will be replaced with the directory path which contains VQE.py

--------- Using VQE functions ---------------

The main functions of VQE.py include:

- VQE_HT
- VQT_Sim

The remaining functions are:

- is_pauli_operator
- pennylane_ham_to_str_ham
- check_ham_input
- YZCircuit
- operator_str_to_hadamard_test
- operator_str_to_cirq_operator
- pretty_print_results

Instructions on their usage can be found in their docstrings.
All of these functions can be imported simultaneously using the following code (executed after adding VQE.py to the python path)

from VQE import *
